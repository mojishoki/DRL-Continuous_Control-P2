The titles of the plots and training histories are mostly self-explanatory. Some of the `ppo...` images are showing the time in which the agent trained and how many episode it took. `ppo400...` refers to using an NN with hidden layers of size 400,300. `ppobatch...` refers to using batchnorm layer. Any `ppo...` file without batch or 400 refers to using an NN with two hidden layers of size 512 without batchnorm.
